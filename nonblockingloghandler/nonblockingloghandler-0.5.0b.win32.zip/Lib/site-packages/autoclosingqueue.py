"""
    A drop-in replacement for Queue.queue, which protects the consumer's thread from being killed before the queue is empty.

    When to use it:
        When you are implementing pool of workers, AND:
          (a) the client does not promise to signal to the consumer thread that it is finished, and may shut-down, AND
          (b) the client does not promise to remain alive until the consumer thread is complete
          (c) you do not have a maximum queue size.

        Under these circumstances, you will find that:
            If the consumer threads are daemons, they may get shut down before processing is finished.
            If the consumer threads are not daemons, they may keep the application alive indefinitely, waiting for items that will
            never arrive.

    How to use it:
        * Make the consumer threads daemons (see threading.daemon).
        * Use this queue for communication instead of queue.Queue.
        * Ensure that the consumer threads call task_done() when complete. (Important!)

    How it works:
        This object delegates the hard work to Queue.queue, but it also has its own thread. This thread is always alive when there
        is an item in the queue to be processed, and shuts down when there isn't. At most, one such thread is alive.

        The thread has no work to do; its role is just to prevent the run-time from shutting down the application, which it will do
        when there are only daemon threads remaining.

    Known Limitations:
        * task_done() must be called by consumer after processing each item, or application will never terminate.
        * PriorityQueues and LifoQueues are not supported, but could be.
        * maxsize is not supported, but could be with more complicated tracking of items.
