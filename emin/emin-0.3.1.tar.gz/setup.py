"""\
emin is a script used to make static HTML-based galleries of
photos, PDFs, diagrams... anything, really. It's primarily
intended for making Web photo galleries for the sorts of
people who don't want to install some PHP monstrosity just
to put their photos online. On the assumption that most people
will want to tweak their gallery's appearance, the output is
fully customisable using the Cheetah templating engine.

Supported image formats are JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, PDF and EPS,
with the latter two being converted to PNG for Web display.
Image resizing, renaming and thumbnailing is supported, as is
building a zip file to download the whole set. Large image sets
can be split over several pages.
